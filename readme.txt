simplifies logging out of the dashboard to a single one click logout after removing the admin tool bar with wp admin bar removal or wp toolbar removal

**This plugin was approved on this repository online since 2011-8-26**

In the WordPress Dashboard, in the upper right corner, one must open and hover through a dropdown menu to logout, which in the minds of some is equivalent to two clicks of a mouse. TWO CLICKS! To enhance the ease of use, this simple plugin alters the logout to occur with a single click.

Generally:

No more maneuvering through annoying dropdown menus.

One click and you're out!

Features:

* Creates a simple one click logout for the WordPress Dashboard.
* Simplifies and drops user profile link.

For one click logout but without the admin bar, remove it using the [Admin Bar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/) plugin by sLa, in conjunction with a forked version of this plugin: [One Click Logout Barless](//wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-logout-barless/), thus restoring a WP 3.2-like header AND one click logout. Or try a fusion of them with [ToolBar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-toolbar-removal/). With all of the above, one click and you're out.

`sLa NGjI's Team do not provide support on wordpress.org forum!`

Dear user of plugins or themes:

`sLa NGjIâ€™s Team has started adventure on
wordpress.org forum since 2007: 7 years ago!`

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the wordpress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable "requests" and those definable "trash" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

With the passage of time, the problems of this type of assistance have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered insufficient or inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.

Our team has tried to respond to all for seven long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean, neat, and clear.

Failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, through the instruments of wordpress.org forum, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since August 7, 2007 to try to give one type of service more personalized, and targeted, to requests of users.

1. For bug's please refer to [sLa NGjI's GitHub ](//github.com/slangji/) bug's report support
1. For tickets please refer to [sLa NGjI's Contact](//slangji.wordpress.com/contact/) tickets form support

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Generally we're not interested to be informed if you like our plugins and themes, or if you use them successfully through the instruments of the wordpress.org forums!

Remember to keep proper behavior on the wordpress.org forum, under the rules, respect all their moderators, and its users: this team do not supporting anymore wordpress.org forum, and the possibility that some of us then reply or write on wordpress.org forum, will be very low!
